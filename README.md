Machine Learning Application for Predicting Varicose Veins Utilizing Global Prevalence Data.

Disclosure

This repository contains the source code for a web application designed to predict the likelihood of developing varicose veins, utilizing global data on disease prevalence. The research underpinning this application can be found in the following publication: DOI: 10.1177/02683555221090054.

The application includes a trained machine learning model alongside a frontend component that features an overlay of a world map on NASA's GRACE Gravity map. Users can input the gravity field by clicking on their location on the map (representing their residence over a lifetime) and manually input other predictors, such as age, gender, and BMI.

The deployed version of this application is available at: https://mlhs.ink/varicose/.
